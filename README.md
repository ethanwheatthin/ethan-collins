# Ethan Collins — Developer Website

This repository contains a small, single-page static website intended for hosting on GitHub Pages. It includes a placeholder headshot, an About/Experience/Projects/Contact layout, and a plain-text resume that visitors can download.

Quick notes:

- To use GitHub Pages, push this repository to GitHub and enable Pages in the repository settings (choose the branch you want to publish from — `main`/`master` or `gh-pages`, and use `/ (root)`).
- Replace `assets/headshot.svg` with your real headshot image (e.g., `assets/headshot.jpg`) and update the `index.html` <img> path if needed.
- Edit `index.html` to tweak any text (contact info, projects, or skills).

Commands (Windows cmd.exe):

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add site files for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

Once pushed, go to your repository on GitHub → Settings → Pages and follow GitHub's instructions to publish the site.
